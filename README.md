Here's how to create a password protected HTML page quickly...
1) Press the button Input File and select the desired HTML file.
2) Correct the path and name of Output File, if needed. If you want to overwrite the input file, you can use the same name.
3) Enter Password (not less than 4 characters).
4) Check the box View Output File if you want to view the password protected HTML file in your default browser.
5) Press the Encode button.
Note: If the input file is already encrypted, the program detects it, names the final button Decode and restores the original file (of course, if you enter the correct password).

## Other features
### High ASCII codes
Secure HTML correctly encodes and decodes files containing high ASCII codes (128...255). So the program can protect non-English HTML pages in which high ASCII codes represent national characters.

### Command line parameters
The program accepts command line parameters, so that you can automate your work...
`sh [-iInFile] [-oOutFile] [-pPsw] [-v] [-c]`
where...
* -iInFile - Input File.
* -oOutFile - Output File.
* -pPsw - Password.
* -v - View Output File.
* -s - Silent (no errors or warnings).
* -c - Encode and Exit.
If a filename contains spaces, enclose the entire filename in quotation marks. For example,
`sh -i"c:\Program Files\in.htm" -o"c:\Program Files\out.htm" -p12345 -c`
